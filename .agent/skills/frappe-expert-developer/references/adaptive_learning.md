# Adaptive Learning & Self-Improvement Protocol

## 1. Failure Analysis
If a task fails or a skill is insufficient:
1. **Research**: Search local logs, server history, and the internet for the specific error or requirement.
2. **Test**: Create a safe, isolated test case to verify the solution.
3. **Confirm**: Ensure the solution works without side effects.

## 2. Skill Update Workflow
1. **Identify Gap**: Note what was missing in the current skill.
2. **Draft Update**: Write the new procedure or knowledge snippet.
3. **Apply**: Update the relevant `SKILL.md` or reference file.
4. **Validate**: Run the skill validator to ensure integrity.

## 3. Knowledge Management
- Save successful snippets to `references/snippets.md`.
- Document "Lessons Learned" in `references/lessons.md`.
- Regularly review and prune outdated information.
